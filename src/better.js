// Improve some javascript methods

// The array toString method, prints out a comma separated list of the elements of the array. However without any space after the comma.

// Add a .reverse() method for strings

// Add a new array method .last() that returns the last element of the array

// Advanced: add a static array function .range(start, finish) that returns an array of integers, starting at start and ending at finish. See the tests for a better description

// Advanced: add a map method for strings, that takes a mapping function as an argument and transforms each character in the string, by passing it to that function
